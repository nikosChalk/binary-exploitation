In order for the exploit to work:

Prerequisites:
1. Attacker is assumed to have IP address: 192.168.59.129
This is because we will spawn a reverse shell

2. The level03 binary should have been started from an ssh session from the root user. This is because of a limitation in our exploit as explained in the "Solution not working" section in the takeaways.md

Solution:

$tty1: nc -lp 55555

$tty2: python solution.py
