# Return to libc (ret2libc)

This is a technique in which, instead of returning to our code, we return to some code of libc.

* `int system(const char *command)` is a very prominent function to return to, as it executes the given command (`man system` for more). Thus we can invoke `system("/bin/sh")` in order to get a shell.
* In this technique, we never execute code from the stack. We find ROP gadgets and chain them appropriately to execute libc code.
Since `system()` returns once it finishes (and does not replace the process' image), it is normal to observe a segmentation fault  after execution.
