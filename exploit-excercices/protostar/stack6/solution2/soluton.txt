In order to run the exploit, run the following command:

(python /home/user/solution.py ; cat) | /opt/protostar/bin/stack6

This solution is an example of ret2libc.

Note that if we do not use cat, then system() returns as soon as the 
stdout file descriptor of our python script closes. That is as soon as
our python script is done.
