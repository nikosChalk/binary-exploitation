In this level we exploited a bug that leads to remote heap overflow in order to execute our custom payload and gain root access. The exploit takes advantage of the `unlink()` macro in the implementation of `free()` in glibc. No new knowledge is presented, but it is a very realistic challenge. A deeper explanation of the exploit can be found in challenge heap3.
