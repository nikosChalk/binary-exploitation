# Takeaways

1. Invisible printed characters through `printf`, still count towards the number of printed characters. Thus, take them into consideration when calculating `%n`.
2. Explanation of `0x%14$08x`
    - `0x` Just a prefix. Regular printed characters
    - `%14$` Take the 14<sup>th</sup> function argument (which is found on the stack)
    - `08` You will print minimum 8 characters (In no case does a nonexistent or small field width cause truncation of a field). The value should be zero (`0`) padded (instead of the regular padding which is whitespaces).
    - `x` Treat the argument as an `unsigned int` and print it in hex
