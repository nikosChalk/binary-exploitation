killall final0
gdb ./final0

(gdb) set follow-fork-mode child
(gdb) run
...

We cannot use CTRL+C in gdb. But we can do this from another root terminal:
$ kill -s TRAP <child pid>

After system() is executed (successful payload), in order to restore the image of the binary that is debugged:
(gdb) file /opt/protostar/bin/final0
