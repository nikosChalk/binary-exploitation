# Takeaways

This is our first remote string format exploit. We demonstrate how to perform this exploit with `pwntools`, utilize its logging capabilities, and perform 2 arbitrary half-word writes in order to write a full word.

## Overview

We overwrite the entry for `strchr` in `.got.plt` section and redirect it to `system()`. Then we simply invoke `strchr("/bin/sh")`.

In order to view the generated log messages, we `cat /var/log/syslog` as root. However, it seems that it does not log huge messages which are a result of our padding. As a temporarily workaround, we can disable the padding in the exploit in order to view the generated messages.
