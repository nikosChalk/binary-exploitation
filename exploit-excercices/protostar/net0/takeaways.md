# Takeaways

In this level, I performed some reverse engineering with a different mindset than what I usually have, i.e. without ghidra. I used `strace` to explore the functionality of the binary and `netstat` to view the network ports that it uses.

In order for `strace` and `netstat` to work properly, they must be ran with root privileges. If we simply ran those programs as a regular user then:
* In `strace` we were getting messages like "Permission denied"
* In `netstat` the "PID/Program name" column was empty (filled with dashes)

In this level, I used the [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/intro.html) ([github](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools/tree/stable)) for the first time. The `solution.py` demonstrates how to send and receive data, to, and from, remote processes through TCP sockets that they are listening on. This is a nice solution instead of working with `netcat`
