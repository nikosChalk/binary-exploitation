# Reconnaissance (recon)

## Using nmap

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA <basename> <target>
```

* `-sC` - Runs the default set of scripts. Generally, a script can belong to one of the following categories:  `auth`, `broadcast`, `brute`, `default`, `discovery`, `dos`, `exploit`, `external`, `fuzzer`, `intrusive`, `malware`, `safe`, `version`, and `vuln`. Script scanning is normally done in combination with a port scan
  * More on [Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html)
  * More [usage and examples](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html) of scripts
* `-sV` - Probe open ports to determine service/version info
* `-oA <basename>` - Output all formats in the given file
  * Usually we use `nmap` as `basename`
* `target` - Hostname or IP address for target to scan
