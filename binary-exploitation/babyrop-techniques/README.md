# Babyrop

With this challenge we examine how does `ret2dlresolve` and `ret2csu` work. We also demonstrate how to use [one-gadget RCE](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget) that is present in the glibc, instead of manually invoking `system` or `execve`. Here are provided three different solutions for this challenge:

* `ret2dlresolve` - Manually written, exposing all the under-the-hood stuff
* `ret2dlresolve` - Automagic 10-line pwntools script that used the `ret2dlresolve` technique underneath
* `ret2csu` - A way to populate gadgets in a gadget-scarce environment. Here, we also use `one_gadget`.

The source code of this challenge is very simple and is nothing more than just:

```C
int main(void) {
  char buf[64];
  
  write(1,"Your name: ",0xb); //11
  gets(buf); //whoopsie. Simple buffer overflow
  return 0;
}
```

Regarding binary info, this is a 64-bit binary with no canary and partial RELRO.

```bash
nikos@laptop:~/ctfs/babyrop$ checksec --file=babyrop
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      Symbols         FORTIFY Fortified       Fortifiable     FILE
Partial RELRO   No canary found   NX enabled    No PIE          No RPATH   No RUNPATH   68) Symbols       No    0               1               babyrop
