## setuid

---

`setuid` – A set-user-id-root program can be used to temporarily drop root privileges. `setuid()` sets the effective user ID of the calling process.
“s” bit in the permissions (e.g. rws) – A binary file that is executed with the setuid bit set, is executed with the privileges of the owner. So a binary owned by root, will run with the privileges of root.

* Example of this is the “sudo” command
* ping also runs as root. Because it requires to send an ICMP packet which is very low level

Also you cannot debug a process that is running under a different user. So you cannot use gdb with a setuid binary.

Orphan Process – An orphan process is a process whose parent has finished or terminated, though it remains running itself. It is sometimes desirable to intentionally orphan a process in order to allow it to run as a daemon (without an associated session).

`netcat <hostname> <port>` – This will establish a TCP connection with the given host at the given port. Input is read from `stdin` (or redirection and pipes can be used)

`pidof <program name>` – Finds the PID of the given named program and prints it on `stdout`.

`kill [-s signal] <PID>` Sends a signal to the specified process.
* Another neat invocation is: `kill [-s signal] $(pidof <program name>)`
* We can also send SIGTRAP signals to running processes that we want to debug when `CTRL+C` might not be working in GDB.

`killall [-s signal] <name>` – Kills all the processes with the given name.

The most common signals are:

* Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description
* `TERM`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`15`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`exit`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be caught for graceful termination (Default)
* `KILL`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`9`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`exit`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot be blocked
* `STOP`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`stop`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot be blocked
* `CONT`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`restart`   Continue if stopped, otherwise ignore
* `TRAP`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`5`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`core`
* `SEGV`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`11`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`core`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Segmentation Violation
