## setuid

---

`setuid` – A set-user-id-root program can be used to temporarily drop root privileges. `setuid()` sets the effective user ID of the calling process.
“s” bit in the permissions (e.g. rws) – A binary file that is executed with the setuid bit set, is executed with the privileges of the owner. So a binary owned by root, will run with the privileges of root.

* Example of this is the “sudo” command
* ping also runs as root. Because it requires to send an ICMP packet which is very low level

Also you cannot debug a process that is running under a different user. So you cannot use gdb with a setuid binary.

Orphan Process – An orphan process is a process whose parent has finished or terminated, though it remains running itself. It is sometimes desirable to intentionally orphan a process in order to allow it to run as a daemon (without an associated session).

`netcat <hostname> <port>` – This will establish a TCP connection with the given host at the given port. Input is read from `stdin` (or redirection and pipes can be used)

`kill <PID>` kills the process with the specified `PID`<br/>
`killall <name>` kills all the processes with the given name.
