## setuid

---

`setuid` – A set-user-id-root program can be used to temporarily drop root privileges. `setuid()` sets the effective user ID of the calling process.
“s” bit in the permissions (e.g. rws) – A binary file that is executed with the setuid bit set, is executed with the privileges of the owner. So a binary owned by root, will run with the privileges of root.

* Example of this is the “sudo” command
* ping also runs as root. Because it requires to send an ICMP packet which is very low level

Also you cannot debug a process that is running under a different user. So you cannot use gdb with a setuid binary.
