# Integer overflow

What is an integer overflow? 
> An Integer Overflow is the condition that occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation, such as multiplication or addition, exceeds the maximum size of the integer type used to store it. ([Source](http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246946/Integer%20Overflows))



How can we take advantage of bugs such as an integer overflow? Well, usually the code pattern in these programs is the following:

```C
int get_size(data) {
    int total_sz = 0;
    for entry in data:
        total_sz += entry.size; // Possible integer overflow
    return total_sz;
}

void f(data) {
    int sz = get_size(data);

    // If sz overflows, this malloc could actually allocate a chunk
    // which is a lot LESS smaller than the programmer expects!
    // Thus leading to further buffer overflow bugs (either in
    // the heap or in the stack).
    void *ptr = malloc(sz); 

}
```
