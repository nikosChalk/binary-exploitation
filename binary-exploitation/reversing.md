`strace` – Runs a given program and traces system calls and signals.<br/>
Flags:
* `-f` &nbsp; Follows forks
* Example: `strace ./a.out`

`cat /etc/passwd` – This will effectively print the users' username, uid, and guid.

`netstat` – A tool for printing processes that consume network resources (e.g. ports, interfaces, etc.) Some common commands are:<br/>
* `netstat -plant`
    * `-p` &nbsp; Shows the processe's `PID`
    * `-l` &nbsp; Shows only the sockets in `LISTEN` state
    * `-a` &nbsp; Shows all sockets that are either in `LISTEN` state or not
    * `-n` &nbsp; Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host, port or user names.
    * `-t` &nbsp; Shows only TCP sockets

    If the output column `PID/Program name` is empty, then you need to run the command wwith `sudo`.
