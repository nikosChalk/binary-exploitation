# ZAP Notes

> OWASP ZAP (short for Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source web application security scanner and can be used as a proxy. Some of the built in features include: Intercepting proxy server, Traditional and AJAX Web crawlers, Automated scanner, Passive scanner, Forced browsing, Fuzzer, WebSocket support, Scripting languages, and Plug-n-Hack support. It has a plugin-based architecture and an online ‘marketplace’ which allows new or updated features to be added. The GUI control panel is easy to use.

## Bugs

1. When sending a request which you have modified by hand, and "Forced User Mode" is enabled, and you are modifying a Cookie, then it is highly possible that when the request is sent, ZAP will append additional cookies at the end, overriding yours. In order to solve this, disable the "Forced User Mode"
