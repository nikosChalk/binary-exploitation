# Gobuster

> Gobuster is a tool used to brute-force:
>
> * URIs (directories and files) in web sites.
> * DNS subdomains (with wildcard support).
> * Virtual Host names on target web servers.

## Tutorial

There is an [excellent tutorial online](https://erev0s.com/blog/gobuster-directory-dns-and-virtual-hosts-bruteforcing/) written by [erev0s](https://github.com/erev0s)

## Modes

### Directory Mode (`dir`)

This is the directory brute-forcing mode

### DNS Mode (`dns`)

In the DNS mode we are looking to find subdomains of a specific domain. Gobuster tries to <u>DNS resolve</u> the subdomains it tries so it can verify if they exist or not, and based on that, give a result. A custom DNS resolver can be used with the `-r` flag

### VHOST Mode (`vhost`)

In vhost mode, gobuster is checking if the subdomains exists by visiting the formed URL with an <u>HTTP request</u> and verifying the IP address. This is different than the DNS mode!

<b>Both DNS Mode and VHOST mode try to identify subdomains as a goal, but in a different way!</b>

## Common uses

```bash
gobuster dir   -u example.com -k -x ".php,.html" -w awesome_wordlist.txt
gobuster dns   -d example.com -w awesome_wordlist.txt
gobuster vhost -u example.com -w awesome_wordlist.txt
```

* `-k` - Skip SSL certificate verification (Useful in CTFs where most certificates are self-signed)
* `-s <string>` - Defines positive status codes (e.g. `"200,301"`) and works like a whitelist filter
* `-b <string>` - Defines negative status codes (e.g. `"404, 405"`) and works like a blacklist filter
* `-x <string>` - File extension(s) to search for (e.g. `".txt,.php"`)
* `-w <wordlist>` - Path to the wordlist file
