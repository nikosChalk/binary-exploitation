To login in the domain `http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/` use credentials:

Username: `natas7`<br/>
Password: `7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9`

We notice that the URL `https://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home` contains a parameter, namely the `page` parameter. This is a potential attack vector and also confirmed by running the "active scan" in the ZAP tool.

Issuing a GET request to the URL `https://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/passwd` gives us all the users of the system but not their passwords. However, from the description of Natas (and also an HTML hint comment), we know that passwords for users are stored in `/etc/natas_webpass/`. As stated in the description:

> E.g. the password for natas5 is stored in the file `/etc/natas_webpass/natas5` and only readable by natas4 and natas5.

So, by issuing a GET request to the URL `https://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8`, we get that the password for level08 is `DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe`

So to login in the level08 use the credentials:

Username: `natas8`<br/>
Password: `DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe`
