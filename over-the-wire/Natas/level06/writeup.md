To login in the domain `http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/` use credentials:

Username: `natas6`<br/>
Password: `aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1`

When we login in to the webpage, we can view the PHP source code. There we observe the line `include "includes/secret.inc";` and also an `if` condition: `if($secret == $_POST['secret'])`

Examining the response from `https://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc`, we get that the value of the expected secret is `FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU`. So, in the available form we submit this secret and as a response we get the password for level07, which is `7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9`

So to login in the level07 use the credentials:

Username: `natas7`<br/>
Password: `7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9`
