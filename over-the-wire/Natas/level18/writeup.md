To login in the domain `http://natas18.natas.labs.overthewire.org` use credentials:

Username: `natas18`<br/>
Password: `xvKIqDjy4OPv7wCRgDlmj0pFsCsDjhdP`

In this level, we have to "login" (no DBMS used here, duh) as `admin` in order to get the credentials for the next level. When we examine the source code, we see that in order to do so, the variable `$_SESSION["admin"]` must have the value `1`. However, there is no way in the code to change that value.

We can only hope that there exists some active session from the user `admin` who has already set that value. The `PHPSESSID` cookie that is set from the server can take numeric values in the range `[1, 640]`. So it should be easy to brute-force and identify the admin page.

Using the python script solution<span>.p</span>y we brute-force the `PHPSESSID` and find out that the password for level 19 is `4IwIrekcuZlA9OsjOkoUtwU6lhokCPYs`

So to login in the level19 use the credentials:

Username: `natas19`<br/>
Password: `4IwIrekcuZlA9OsjOkoUtwU6lhokCPYs`
