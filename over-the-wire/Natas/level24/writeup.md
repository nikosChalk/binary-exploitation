To login in the domain `http://natas24.natas.labs.overthewire.org` use credentials:

Username: `natas24`<br/>
Password: `OsRmXFguozKpTZZ5X14zNO43379LZveg`

Once we login we are greeted with a password form. In order to get the credentials for the next level, we need to make the following condition evaluate to true:<br/>
`!strcmp($_REQUEST["passwd"], "<censored>")`

Does this mean that we have to brute-force the password that the server expects? Well, in fact not. There is no sanitization applied to the `passwd` GET parameter. Thus we can send an `array` instead of a string. A sample request would be `GET /index.php?passwd[]=A`. What happens if we `strcmp` an object of type `array` with a `string`. We get a `NULL` value. The negation of `NULL` evaluates to true and hence the whole condition `!strcmp($_REQUEST["passwd"], "<censored>")` evaluates to true.

So with a simple `GET /index.php?passwd[]=A` request, we are presented with the password for the next level, which is `GHF6X7YwACaYYssHVY05cFq83hRktl4c`

So to login in the level25 use the credentials:

Username: `natas25`<br/>
Password: `GHF6X7YwACaYYssHVY05cFq83hRktl4c`
