To login in the domain `http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/` use credentials:

Username: `natas5`<br/>
Password: `iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq`

When we log in we are greeted with the message "Access disallowed. You are not logged in". When reviewing the HTTP request we observe that there is a cookie header:<br/>
`Cookie: loggedin=0`<br/>
Editing the request and setting the cookie's value to `1` and then sending it, we get the password for level06 in the response, which is `aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1`

So to login in the level06 use the credentials:

Username: `natas6`<br/>
Password: `aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1`
