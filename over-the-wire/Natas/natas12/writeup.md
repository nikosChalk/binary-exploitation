To login in the domain `http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org` use credentials:

Username: `natas12`<br/>
Password: `EDXp0pS26wLKHZy1rDBPUZk0RKfLGIR3`

In this level we are presented with a file submission form. Using the "Show/Enable" feature for ZAP we quickly notice that there are two hidden fields alongside the file upload form (also confirmed by the source code). Looking at the code, we notice that the generated link will have whatever suffix is present in the `filename` input tag.

Getting a little creative now, what if we could execute PHP code on the server? What if we could uploaded a file PHP file, and in the `filename` input specify a ".php" extension? That is exactly what we do in order to solve this level. We create a small PHP script (payload.php) that prints the contents of `/etc/natas_webpass/natas13` and upload it to the server. Then follow the generated link to retrieve the password, which is `jmLTY0qiPZBbaKc9341cqPQZBJv7MQbY`.

We also tried various reverse shells but none worked. Possibly the firewall is configured properly for this level.

So to login in the level13 use the credentials:

Username: `natas13`<br/>
Password: `jmLTY0qiPZBbaKc9341cqPQZBJv7MQbY`
