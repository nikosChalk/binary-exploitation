To login in the domain `http://natas23.natas.labs.overthewire.org` use credentials:

In this level the developer messed up big time. The condition that we must satisfy here is `strstr($_REQUEST["passwd"], "iloveyou") && ($_REQUEST["passwd"] > 10 )`. This means:

1. `$_REQUEST["passwd"]` must contain the string `iloveyou`
2. (Spoiler alert - Developer messed up!) The <i>string value</i> `$_REQUEST["passwd"]` must be greater than `10`. What?

Okay, probably the developer meant that the password <i>length</i> must be greater than 10 characters, but got it wrong. So, lets look what happens when we compare a string to a number in the manual page of PHP. According to the [String conversion to numbers ](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.conversion) entry:

> The value is given by the initial portion of the string. If the string starts with valid numeric data, this will be the value used. Otherwise, the value will be 0 (zero). Valid numeric data is an optional sign, followed by one or more digits (optionally containing a decimal point), followed by an optional exponent. The exponent is an 'e' or 'E' followed by one or more digits.

In our case, if the string starts with any number greater than `10`, say `20`, then the condition will evaluate to true

So, the password `20iloveyou` gives us the password for level24, which is `OsRmXFguozKpTZZ5X14zNO43379LZveg`

So to login in the level24 use the credentials:

Username: `natas24`<br/>
Password: `OsRmXFguozKpTZZ5X14zNO43379LZveg`
