To login in the domain `http://natas22.natas.labs.overthewire.org` use credentials:

Username: `natas22`<br/>
Password: `chG9fbe1Tq2eWVMgjYYD1MsfIvN461kJ`

This level is very simple. From the source code we know that if the parameter `revelio` is set in a GET request, then the credentials will be presented to us. However, if the `$_SESSION["admin"] == 1` is false, we will be redirected to the top level domain `/` with a `302 Found` status code and the parameter `revelio` will be lost. So with 1 request we have 2 responses.

What the developer did wrong in this case, is that after the line `header("Location: /");` (which adds the aforementioned header) he did not add the statement `exit;` so that further PHP code will not be executed and the credentials will not be presented to us. So if we examine the response with the `302 Found` response code, we see that the password for level23 is `D0vlad33nQF0Hz2EP255TP5wSW9ZsRSE`

So to login in the level23 use the credentials:

Username: `natas23`<br/>
Password: `D0vlad33nQF0Hz2EP255TP5wSW9ZsRSE`
