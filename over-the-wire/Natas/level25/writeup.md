To login in the domain `http://natas25.natas.labs.overthewire.org` use credentials:

Username: `natas25`<br/>
Password: `GHF6X7YwACaYYssHVY05cFq83hRktl4c`

## This level includes

* Uploading malicious PHP code in log files
* Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack
  * LFI performed in the log files containing the malicious input
* Filter Bypass

## Idea

1. Upload malicious PHP code in the server's log file, using the "User-Agent" HTTP header
    * The PHP code, when executed, will dump the file "/etc/natas_webpass/natas26", because due to the filter we cannot perform an LFI attack to dump it
2. Perform an LFI attack to `include()` the log file, thus executing the malicious PHP code
3. Extract the password from the response

## Solution

Run `python solution.py` in order to solve the level

So to login in the level26 use the credentials:

Username: `natas26`<br/>
Password: `oGgWAJ7zcGT28vYazGo4rkhOPDhBu34T`
