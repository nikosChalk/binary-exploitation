To login in the domain `http://natas19.natas.labs.overthewire.org` use credentials:

Username: `natas19`<br/>
Password: `4IwIrekcuZlA9OsjOkoUtwU6lhokCPYs`

This level is very similar to Natas level19. However, here we are not given the source code, but the hint:<br/>
> This page uses mostly the same code as the previous level, but session IDs are no longer sequential...

So, using Burp we send a request with parameters `username=admin&password=admin` and get in the response the cookie `PHPSESSID=3534352d61646d696e;`. Now these are printable hex characters so lets decode it:

```bash
xxd -r -p <(echo 3534352d61646d696e); echo ""
545-admin
```

Hmm, this seems to be like the random user ID seen in the previous level (range `[1, 640]`), followed by a dash, followed by username or password. In order clear things out, lets try again and differentiate the username from the password. Lets set the parameters to `username=admin&password=AAAA`. Now the cookie in the response is `342d61646d696e`. Lets decode it again

```bash
xxd -r -p <(echo 342d61646d696e); echo ""
4-admin
```

Cool! So the last part it the username, not the password. Now we can brute-force the session for the `admin` user just like we did in the previous level, using a similar python script python<span>.p</span>y. With the script we get that the password for the next level is `eofm3Wsshxc5bwtVnEuGIlr7ivb9KABF`

So to login in the level20 use the credentials:

Username: `natas20`<br/>
Password: `eofm3Wsshxc5bwtVnEuGIlr7ivb9KABF`
