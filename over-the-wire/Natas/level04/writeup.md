Username: `natas4`<br/>

When we login we are greeted with the message:

```
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
Refresh page

This points to the fact that our request should have the header:<br/>

When doing so, we are greeted with the password of level05 which is `iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq`
